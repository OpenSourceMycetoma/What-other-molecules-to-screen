# What-other-molecules-to-screen

This repository is for suggestions for new lines of inquiry in MycetOS (open source mycetoma) towards medicines to treat eumycetoma.

People often have ideas for new molecules, new series or new targets. If you do, start an "Issue", above, and provide as much detail as you can so that people can comment.

If one of these ideas gets started, it can form its own series and its own repository.
